The Short

Hi there, I'm Alex. I'm a developer and designer living in London. I like to focus on Mobile and Web based development and design. Exploring the new ways to interact in these mediums. I have recently graduated with a First Class Honours degree in Multimedia Computing from the University of Westminster.

The Long

I was born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland. A small and unimportant place but one which shall always be my hometown. After many happy years there growing up and getting my education, I left at the age of 18 to spend the majority of the next year living, working and traveling in South-East Asia. Most of this time spent in Thailand and Laos.
Eventually, like all good things, this had to end and I returned to the UK. Once back, I moved accross the water (as they say back home) to London, England, mainly to study Multimedia Computing at the University of Westminster - but also because living in big cities is just seriously cool. I know it's not for everyone but I love them. London after all is one of the biggest and most vibrant in Europe. I couldnâ€™t resist the opportunity to become a Londoner and complain about rent, transport and everything in between.
Fast forward three years and I've graduated from University and well and truly become a Londoner.
