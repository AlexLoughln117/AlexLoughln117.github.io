#### The Short:

When Jordan Jarrett-Bryan came to Drew London with the Blakademik project he explained it in such a clear and succinct way, we couldn’t say no. From Jordan, as he explains it best, It’s All Blakademik is an online show giving intelligent & engaging black individuals a space to debate current affairs. Conscious, honest and progressive chat is what we are about.
We knew that the website for Blakademik had to be as bold and vibrant as the show and discussions themselves.

During this project, I delivered the entire website including all frontend work and the small amount of backend work needed. Involved from the first client meeting, I worked closely with the lead designer to make sure the final website matched their designs as closely as possible.
The website itself is a fully custom Wordpress theme including Gulp and CircleCi integration to link version control, code compiling and deployment.
