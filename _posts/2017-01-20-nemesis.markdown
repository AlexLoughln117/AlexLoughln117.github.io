The 5th book in the Expanse series is every bit as excellent as its predecessors. James S.A perfectly blends detailed and touching character stories with galaxy spanning space operatics. So rarely does sci-fi meld them both into a good book. Itâ€™s either wafer thin characters or time bending nonsense but Corey manages to avoid the pitfalls. Delivering one of the best sci-fi series I have ever read. If you want Game of Thrones meets Fifth Element then read this series.
