  One of Londonâ€™s oldest estate agents needed a new website to reintroduce themselves to Southgate.
---
#### The Short:

Rash&Rash is one of London's oldest estate agents and when they approached Drew London under a new owner they were looking to reintroduce themselves in a fresh and modern way. This represented an exciting opportunity to launch Rash&Rash to whole new audience while retraining everything that their existing clients loved. For Drew we saw a lot of estate agents didn't stand out in the modern digital world. So with a clean and exciting website Rash&Rash would be able to stand up and take on the big players in the industry.

During this project I delivered most of the website including all front end work and the small amount of backend work needed. The largest back end job of integrating the clients property management software with Wordpress was done by the help of free-lance developer. Involved from the first client meeting, I worked closely with the lead designer to make sure the final website matched their designs as closely as possible.
The website itself is a fully custom Wordpress theme including Gulp and CircleCi integration to link version control, code compiling and deployment. Plus custom integration between Expert Agent and Wordpress.
