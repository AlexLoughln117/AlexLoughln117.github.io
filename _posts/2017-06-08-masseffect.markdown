I hate to write this, but Mass Effect Andromeda is a bad game. But what’s maybe worse to me personally, it’s a bad Bioware game. It feels like a game made in the style of Bioware, not by Bioware.

To most Mass Effect fans, it wasn’t the combat or exploration that made them love the series but the characters. People like Garrus and Wrex who became the soul of the series. It was this real, emotional attachment that made the suicide mission from 2 so harrowing or the minor party conversations so touching.
Yet that’s sadly where Andromeda falls apart. The characters are just devoid of any real spark of life. Sure there are attempts at interesting characters but they all fall flat. Especially Jaal, one of a new race which is meant to speak very literally. But it ends up just being an excuse for the voice actor to deliver everything in monotone.

And don’t even get me started on the main plot thread. You’re telling me, we travelled through deep space to a brand new galaxy. And this one, just like the last, has an ancient long gone race of aliens who were super advanced? Ok, maybe they ran out of time.
Granted, the combat is much improved but in reality that matters very little when the soul is missing.
