Having come to this after seeing the film, the novel is a completely different beast. Altogether much darker and much funnier, Under the Skin is a great tale of an alien view looking in on humanity and all itâ€™s flaws. Featuring an alien who must kidnap men, it is through these men that her own notions of humanity and compassion are challenged. A fascinating journey of a book that is nothing like you will expect. A definite must read.
