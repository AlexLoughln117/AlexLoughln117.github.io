The National Gallery Hunt is a web app based treasure hunt game. It's centred around exploring The National Gallery. One of London’s top attractions and most famous art galleries in the world. Users will be encouraged to explore the Gallery in a way they would never do just walking around on their own. All while learning a great deal about some of the most famous paintings in the world. And in a way that is much more exciting than a simple blurb beside the painting itself or an audio guide.

The National Gallery Hunt was built using HTML5, CSS and jQuery. HTML and Css were used to structure and style the site. With the jQuery being used for all the game logic.
It was designed and created by a team of four people. Each of us having a hand in the planning, design and implementation.
A first prototype had to be delivered to a very tight deadline. This meant the focus of the project was on proving the functionality and idea of the game. Styling and layout will be refined for the second prototype. 

The National Gallery Hunt was designed and built to satisfy a brief to create a mobile focused treasure hunt game built for the web. With a special focus that the game should be educational in some aspect.

The National Gallery in London was chosen as the specific location for the game because it is one of the most important art galleries in the world. But like all art galleries, there can be a disconnect for a lot of visitors. They visit and look at all the famous paintings, but without a lot of context or interesting information, a lot of visitors simply gloss over the paintings. They only take in the minimum and move on. No longer really enjoying it even though they want to. Everyone starts with good intentions but eventually this can only take you so far.

So this is where The National Gallery Hunt comes in. It will fill this gap and keep visitors engaged with exploring the National Gallery to its fullest.

The National Gallery Hunt will encourage visitors to explore The National Gallery using a multi-stage game. The game shall take them through every section of the gallery starting from the entrance and ending there.

The aim of the game is to successfully name 10 different paintings located with The National Gallery. Visitor’s will have 4 steps within the game to identify each painting. The earlier they successfully name the painting the more points they will receive.

How the Game Works

The first step on each painting, Visitor’s are shown a quarter section of the painting in question. They can either try and guess the name or move onto the next step.

The second step, Visitors are given a code puzzle to break, this code is the date of the painting. As The National Gallery is organised into sections by time period. The Visitor can now go to this specific area of the gallery and look for the painting. Again they can guess the name of it or move onto the next step.

The third step is a tumbled word puzzle. This puzzle is the name of the painter who created said painting. Finally on the fourth step, Visitor’s are shown half of the painting.

By now they should be able to locate the painting and thus it’s name and enter it for points.

Having tested and used The National Gallery Hunt. It does encourage and reward visitors to explore the gallery more than they normally would. And it adds an element of fun and competition that would not be there normally.
