By the time Assassins Creed Rogue came out, no one's being mean when they say the series was well past it’s best. The formula was creaking under the weight of new features that were being added as it was being wheeled out annually. Resulting in the ungodly mess of a launch that was Assassins Creed Unity. And Rogue, by being the last-gen little brother to Unity suffered by association. Now in 2020, Assassins Creed looks nothing like it did in 2014, having morphed into a vast Witcher-Esque RPG and so Rogue looks quaint in comparison. But to my shock, the old Assassins formula still has legs, all we needed was some distance from it to appreciate it again. Playing Rogue made it clear why AC became such a hit in the first place and though some of it hasn’t aged well, it’s still a great game.
