The Wind Up Bird Chronicle might be as complex a novel as Murakami has ever done. A simple story of a disintegrating marriage starts Toru Okada on a journey which sees him slowly pulled into an otherworldly place laying below the surface of Tokyo. Nothing is what is seems in this novel but Murkami guides you through which such heart, emotion and humour you canâ€™t help but fall in as deep as the protagonist.
