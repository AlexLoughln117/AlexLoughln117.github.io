Rise of the Tomb Raider is a good game, definitely. But I can’t help feeling that if I’d played it on its original release in 2015, that I would have been blown away. It’s a testament to how many great games have come out in 2017 so far, that Tomb Raider just can’t keep up.

With all that said, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a damn fine game. Having successfully rebooted Tomb Raider a few years ago, Rise feels like the game they meant and wanted to make the first time around. This time around Lara is haunted by her father’s death and his failed obsession/quest to find a new McGuffin. His obsession becomes Lara’s and takes her to the mountains of Siberia. Which is the perfect setting for dangerous snowy mountain trekking, surprisingly lush jungles and awe-inspiring lost cities. Really everything that you could want from a Tomb Raider game.

The combat which felt so great previously continues to be great fun. Lara moves smoothly, with a wide variety of combat options to tackle the large environments. And the best part of these areas are the not so hidden, hidden challenge tombs. Basically huge single room puzzles that really breathe life into the fantasy of a bad ass tomb raider.

Sadly for Rise of the Tomb Raider, the industry has moved so quickly that it can’t help but feel old. But get past that feeling and you’ll find a good game that shows Lara Croft isn’t done yet. This classic character has still got life in her yet.
