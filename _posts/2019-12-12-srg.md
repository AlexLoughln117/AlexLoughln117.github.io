The SRG Movement is an exciting new charity based in Scotland who came to Drew London looking for an identity and website that would make them stand above the crowd.

Self Reliant Groups are a place to try new things, generate income, or just meet new people. SRGs are small groups of people who encourage each other, try new things, and do more of what they love. Some groups pursue a passion, some groups create products or services, and some groups generate income. Join us to do something a bit different, or just meet people. No skills/business plans/confidence required.

I was involved in building the entire website for the SRG Movement. The site is built on Wordpress using a custom theme built solely for this site. The codebase includes Gulp to compile and minify the code, we then use CircleCi to integrate version control and server deployment.
