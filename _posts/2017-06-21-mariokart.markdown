Mario Kart is pure joy, like the essence of a Saturday morning cartoon. It has always felt this way for me and Mario Kart 8: Deluxe is thankfully no exception.

Starting with Mario Kart 64 as a kid, soaring over the jumps in Wario Stadium and I’ve been hooked on that infectious Mario Kart joy ever since. Mario Kart 8 might just be the best incarnation for karting simulator yet. The most fun I’ve had with Mario Kart since my first time playing 64 as a kid. The driving feels amazing, the tracks are fun and varied, and the graphics with their vibrant colours leap out from the screen like an explosion of fun.

Nintendo knew they were onto a winner with 8 and re-packaging it for the Switch was the perfect move. There is no better game right now which showcases the strengths of the Switch as a unique console. On the bus or at home, it’s full-tilt, no holds barred Mario Kart. Being able to play multiplayer Mario Kart on a train with just one little console is an experience that’s just cool. This would have blown 8-year-old Alex’s mind. Mario Kart is great, everyone knows that, but Mario Kart 8, is Mario Kart perfection.
