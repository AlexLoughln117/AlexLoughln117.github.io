This game has more style than anything in years, it’s like Persona 5 but instead of acid-infused jazz, it’s all about Brutalism and office culture. I am in love with everything about this game, the story, the style of the world and the gameplay. It just grabbed me like nothing else has for a while. Control is the story of Jessie Faden, recently appointed Director of Federal Bureau of Control, trying to track down information on her brother’s disappearance. This leads her to the FBC and a seemingly normal looking New York office called The Oldest House. Imagine the FBI but they investigate the x-files and it’s set in an ever-changing and shifting Brutalist office cum hellscape. Honestly, if that sentence alone doesn’t pique your interest then this game is not for you. All you need to know going into Control is the basic setup and the rest is for you to explore.
