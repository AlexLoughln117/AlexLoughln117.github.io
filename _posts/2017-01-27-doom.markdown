Games should be fun, first and foremost. Yes, they can be and are art. But sometimes you just want to lose yourself in exactly what video games are, games. This is what Doom sets out to do and thankfully, achieves.

At it’s best, everything else slips away in Doom and you get caught up in a whirlwind of shooting, gore and fun. You are the Doom Slayer, whose sole purpose in life hasn’t changed since he first made an appearance in 1993. He must eradicate every single spawn of Hell that wants to destroy humanity, and boy do you! With a speed that modern video games have forgotten, you zip about the areas of Mars and Hell like a rocket-powered ice skater. Blasting every living Hell Spawn, into tiny pieces with whatever you can get your hands on, and failing that, your actual own hands.

Forget your boring military orgasm-simulators of the last generation, Doom is unabashedly a video game of a different era. But reborn in such a great way to show why this style was such a hit all those years ago. Play Doom, and join me in revelling in the bombast and style of the 90s reborn in glorious 2017 definition.
