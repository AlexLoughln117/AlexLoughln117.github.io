Writing about Dishonoured 2 is sad. Not sad because of the game itself, in fact, the opposite is true. But sad because more people didn’t play this game, that more people didn’t get to support a team of people who have picked up the choose-your-own stealth genre and did it as well as the greats of Thief and Deus Ex.

But Dishonoured 2 is exactly that, a new Thief for 2017. Large open levels and a whole grab bag full of magical tricks. The basic premise is simple, get to the end point of the level. As an assassin, it usually ends with a target to kill but with seemingly endless possibilities of how to get there and how to do. You can be the ultimate sleuth, hugging the shadows and only darting out when a guard’s back is turned or run in with your sword drawn. But the greatness of Dishonoured is that the game is so beautifully fluid, you can move from one play-style to the next and the game constantly keeps up. No decision you take locks you out of changing things up. Got yourself in over your head in a sword fight. Teleport over a wall and send your doppelganger to distract the guards then trying sneaking for a bit.

The world is yours to play and Dishonoured makes it so fun to do. Now to play their next game Prey, and hope they stick around.
